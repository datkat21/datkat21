I'm Kat21, a web developer and designer based in the United States. I enjoy programming in JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP and more!

The name *kat* comes from an old username of mine from 2015. It does not stand for anything, not any girl names.

The *21* in Kat21 is also from around the same time when Vine was getting popular. There was a meme called "*9 + 10 = 21*", which got really popular due to the kid featured in it being silly for what he said.

Around 2019, I decided to incorporate *21* into my name because it just fit in pretty well, and having the same name of _DaCuteKittyKat_ (yes, that's the name from 2015, I was young at the time) for so long would not be that much fun.

Below is a list containing some of my best projects:

* Saturn by [ZeonDev](https://github.com/zeondev)  
  A JavaScript Web OS project, similar to something like [os-js](https://os-js.org). **Currently unavailable while it's in development.**   
  Instead, see [Saturn-Core](https://github.com/zeondev/saturn-core), our template for creating web apps that use their own kind of package system.

* [Amoled Discord Dark Theme](https://github.com/datkat21/Amoled-Dark-Theme-for-Discord)    
  A custom CSS theme you can inject into Discord which turns the colors to AMOLED (pitch-black). Used to look good, mostly untested with how much Discord has changed now.
* [PowerPoint Discord Rich Presence](https://github.com/datkat21/PowerPoint-Discord-RPC)    
  A Microsoft PowerPoint add-in that enables Discord Rich Presence using [DiscordRPC for C#](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp).
* [Stylus Themes](https://github.com/datkat21/stylus-themes)     
  A collection of styles that will improve your experience (usualy add dark mode and improve customization) on certain websites. These were tested on the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) extension only.
  

Below is a list of older projects (that won't get updates) that I still like: 

* [sShell](https://github.com/sshell-git/sShell)    
    A somewhat functioning, mostly unfinished Windows Explorer replacement made in WPF/XAML.
* [MiniShell](https://github.com/limeyteam/minishell)   
    A half working "shell" made in Bash for some reason. Mostly made for fun to test my scripting skills.

My PC is a bit specced if I were only using it for development, but I mainly bought it for playing some demanding video games like [Tower Unite](https://towerunite.com/) ([Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/394690)), which I have hundreds of hours in since I bought the game in 2016. I'm not affiliated with PixelTail Games, but I heavily enjoy their amazing game.

I use a prebuilt, specifically the [Alienware Aurora R9](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/alienware-aurora-r9-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r9-desktop). I may build a PC in the future if I want to.
