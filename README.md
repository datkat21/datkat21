The name *kat* comes from an old username of mine from 2015. It just means _cat_, but with a K, hence "Kat".

The *21* in Kat21 is also from around the same time when Vine was getting popular. There was a meme called "*9 + 10 = 21*", which got really popular due to the kid featured in it being silly for what he said.

Around 2019, I decided to incorporate *21* into my name because it just fit in pretty well, and having the same name of _DaCuteKittyKat_ (yes, that's the name from 2015, I was young at the time) for so long would not be that much fun.

Below is a couple of my favorite projects:

Here's a list of older projects (that won't get updates) that other people use:

My PC is quite performant if I were only using it for development, but I also use it for gaming.

I use a prebuilt, specifically the [Alienware Aurora R9](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/alienware-aurora-r9-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r9-desktop). I may build a PC in the future if I want to.
